# Hardware

Hardware collection of roles for BlueBanquise collection set.

This collection regroups hardware (GPU, Interconnect, etc.) related roles.
Note that since hardware has a cost, I may not support all kind of hardware in these roles.

## List of roles:

* [roles/gpu](roles/gpu): install driver for GPU.
* [roles/interconnect](roles/interconnect): install driver and subnet-manager of Infiniband interconnect.
* [roles/rasdaemon](roles/rasdaemon): install and configure rasdaemon (ECC RAM monitoring).
