# CHANGELOG

This is an attempt to better organise devs logs

2024-09-28: Remove Kofi sponsor, add UNICEF link.
2024-09-28: Starting from ansible-core 2.17, mandatory python version on client side is 3.7.
            RHEL 8 and OpenSuse Leap 15 brings Python 3.6 by default.
            Now PXE will automatically install Python 3.11 on both OS to allow Ansible discoverer to uses these versions.
            Note that only OpenSuse 15.6 brings Python 3.11 in the ISO for PXE, making it a mandatory minor version.
